Asynchronous Python (asyncio) Project
Learning Objectives
This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python using the asyncio library. By the end of this project, you will be able to:

Understand and use the async and await syntax in Python for asynchronous operations.
Execute an async program with asyncio.
Run concurrent coroutines to improve program efficiency.
Create asyncio tasks to manage asynchronous operations effectively.
Utilize the Python random module within asynchronous code.
Requirements
General
Python Version: Python 3.7
Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
Code Style and Documentation
All code files follow the pycodestyle (version 2.5.x) coding style guide.
Code files have a newline at the end.
The first line of code files starts with #!/usr/bin/env python3.
Functions and coroutines are appropriately type-annotated.
Modules have documentation using python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'.
Functions have documentation using python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'. The documentation consists of clear and meaningful sentences describing the purpose of the function.
